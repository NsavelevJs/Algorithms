This doc is mainly used for understand big O analysis 

The 7 main time complexity:

O(1) Constant:

- The number of steps does not depend on the input size

example: 
Please see 
constantTime.py


O(log(n)) Logarithmic:

 - the number of steps can be expressed as a logarithm on the input size

 - oppisite of an exponent
 - essentially just a repeated division instead of a repeated multiplication 

 example: 
 
 Please See logTime.py

O(n) Linear time:
 - number of steps it takes it contingent on the times it needs to run. 

 Please see
  linearTime.py

  O(n*log(n)) Loglinear

  - Has linear behavior nested in log steps
  - Bigger than O(n) but smaller than O(n^2)

  Please see 
  logLin.py
